- 👋 Hi, I’m @ARadHatter
- 👀 I’m interested in faqmiliarizing myself with Python and hobbyist coding with an end goal of vulnerability testing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python but am adding go, C, SQL and others to my reperotoire as well!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, I don't feel like I can contribute to any project.
- 📫 How to reach me: DM is probably best for project proposals. I will find an alternative platform communicate if I am actively working with someone.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have learned how to lockpick and so I thought learning to code seemed a natural upgrade.
